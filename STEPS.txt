### ðŸŒ³ **Sentiment Analysis using Decision Tree â€” Step-by-Step ()**

---

### âœ… **1. Define the Objective**

Decide what you want to analyze â€” for example, classify **movie reviews** as **positive** or **negative**.

---

### âœ… **2. Collect the Data**

Gather a dataset of text reviews with sentiment labels.
Example: IMDb movie reviews with labels like **positive** or **negative**.

---

### âœ… **3. Clean and Prepare the Text**

* Remove unwanted characters (punctuation, numbers, etc.)
* Convert all text to lowercase
* Remove stop words (e.g., "the", "is", "in")
* Tokenize the text (split into words)

---

### âœ… **4. Convert Text to Numbers**

Use a **vectorization technique** to convert text into numerical features:

* **Count Vectorization**: Counts word occurrences
* **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Weighs words based on frequency and uniqueness

---

### âœ… **5. Split the Data**

Divide the dataset into:

* **Training Set**: Used to build the model (e.g., 80%)
* **Testing Set**: Used to evaluate model performance (e.g., 20%)

---

### âœ… **6. Build the Decision Tree Model**

* Use the training data to **train a Decision Tree classifier**
* The tree learns patterns from the word frequencies and labels

---

### âœ… **7. Make Predictions**

Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of the reviews in the test set.

---

### âœ… **8. Evaluate the Model**

Check how well the model performs using metrics like:

* **Accuracy**: How many predictions were correct
* **Precision/Recall/F1-score**: Quality of positive and negative predictions

---

### âœ… **9. Visualize the Decision Tree** *(Optional)*

* You can plot the decision tree structure to understand how decisions are made

---

### âœ… **10. Improve the Model** *(Optional)*

* Try tuning parameters, using a deeper tree, or switching to other models (like Random Forest, SVM)
